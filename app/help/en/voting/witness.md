# Witnesses

Witnesses are entities that work for the blockchain by constructing new blocks. Their role is similar to the role of miners for Bitcoin and other blockchains. Each witness is approved by the shareholders and constructs and signs blocks from validated transactions. Every transaction made in the network is required to be validated by all witnesses.

## Consensus Mechanism

Who exactly is allowed to *produce* a block at which time instant is defined by a
consensus mechanism called *Delegated Proof of Stake*. In essence, you, the
shareholders of BitShares can cast a vote for your preferred block producers on the blockchain. Those *witnesses* with the most votes are allowed to produce blocks.
