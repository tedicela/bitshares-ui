# Proxy

You may choose to **not** be active in the governance of Bitshares. If this is the case, it's important that you choose someone in the Bitshares community who you identify with and set that entity as your proxy. This gives them to the power to vote on your behalf with your BTS shares backing their vote. This is similar to electing a representative.
